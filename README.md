# Silent Date Parsing Failure in NSDateFormatter

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in Objective-C when using `NSDateFormatter` to parse dates from strings.  If the input string does not conform to the expected format, `NSDateFormatter` might fail silently, returning `nil` without raising an error. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes later in the code.

The `bug.m` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides a robust solution that handles potential parsing failures gracefully.

## Problem

`NSDateFormatter`'s lack of explicit error handling can make it difficult to detect date parsing issues.  Malformatted input strings can lead to silent failures, making debugging challenging.

## Solution

The solution implements comprehensive error handling by checking the return value of `dateFromString:` and handling the `nil` case appropriately.  This prevents unexpected behavior and ensures the application gracefully handles malformed date strings.
